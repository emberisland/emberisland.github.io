Ember Island Players Theatre would like to reach out and invite all artists to audition in an open casting call, but will prioritize opportunities for artists who identify with the Asian and Pacific Islander diaspora.  

Please fill out [the form linked here to schedule an audition.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgHSR7Ucwrc6vlTXc9FLk42b1i6WssGKr_1Tc-mN2lsC5dSw/viewform?fbclid=IwAR2e6p6yreOX0mtON4GgfI3todBM3Ozy3n0ZU2xBqImpG6f6ZvDCutflUzM)

“An infamous tale, Sweeney Todd, an unjustly exiled barber, returns to nineteenth century London, seeking vengeance against the lecherous judge who framed him and ravaged his young wife. The road to revenge leads Todd to Mrs. Lovett, a resourceful proprietress of a failing pie shop, above which, he opens a new barber practice. Mrs. Lovett's luck sharply shifts when Todd's thirst for blood inspires the integration of an ingredient into her meat pies that has the people of London lining up... and the carnage has only just begun!”

Please prepare a 32+ bar/~1 minute cut from a classical musical theatre song. This selection can be performed with an accompanist (with sheet music), or a capella. Examples of appropriate classical musicals include: West Side Story, Les Misérable, Into The Woods, The Sound of Music, etc. We would advise against excerpts from pop songs and contemporary musical theatre such as Rent, Hamilton, Tommy, etc. as they do not adequately reflect the musical style of the show. Please, feel free to contact us if you have any further questions about your selection!
