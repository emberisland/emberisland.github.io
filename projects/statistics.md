title: 'Statistics Remount'
---

Missed the U of T Drama Festival this year? Never fear! St Michael's College Troubadours and Ember Island Players proudly present a remount of Statistics, a new musical premiered at the festival this year!

Directed by Anastasia Liu
Written by Shreya Jha
Stage Managed by Claire Ellis (+shoutout to the original stage managers Rida Ahmad and Rahaf Fasheh!)

It is 1951. The race to find the structure of DNA is in full swing, and strong-minded, tight-lipped scientists work side by side in a lab at King’s College London. Among them: Rosalind Franklin, a young, brilliant female scientist surrounded by male colleagues.
On the other side of the stage, it is 2017. Rose and Angie, two students entering their fourth year of undergrad, grapple with the medical school admission process as well as the stress, the pressure, and deadlines their university throws at them.
As each timeline plays out, two female scientists from different eras, dealing with two different types of institutional pressures, form a connection of grit, motivation, self-doubt, and the desire to constantly keep learning and growing.
