**A PERFECT BOWL OF PHỞ**

The year is 2019. An open-minded Toronto theatre audience (read: unsuspecting victims) sits down in Factory Theatre Studio to watch a play about the history of pho, the Vietnamese rice noodle soup (read: a thinly-veiled metaphor for Viet culture and identity). They came to see theatre that's diverse (read: a lot of Asians plus one white guy), thought-provoking (read: pandering to educated liberals), and fun (read: it's a musical), all from the mind of one talented young Vietnamese-Canadian playwright (read: a narcissist). A hush falls over the crowd as a flute plays, and lights rise on a poor Vietnamese farmer...

**FINE CHINA**

What do the phrases: ‘you should eat,’ ‘don’t stay out too late’ and ‘put on a jacket’ have in common? They’re the first-generation immigrant way of saying ‘I love you.’ Love is embedded so deeply in our words and actions that we forget it’s there. It becomes as much the source of conflict as it is for healing. As estranged sisters Kim and Audrey reconnect after the death of their father old tensions arise, repressed feelings come to a head, and appliances are broken as the fate of the family is left in question.

January 23 - February 10, 2019 at the Factory Theatre Studio (125 Bathurst St.)
