Director’s note -
It is our yearning for the answer to the question, “Who are you?”, and, alongside this, “Where can I be?”, that informs almost all of our struggles, desires, and dreams as human beings. Tonight, we, the voices of “an other tries to speak”, fictional characters and real creators alike, share with you a snapshot of this process of yearning and discovery in progress. We do not know the answers, but we are taking the journey towards finding them, and we thank you for joining us on it.
